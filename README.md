# parseHRV
R scripts to parse and plot heart rate variability (HRV) data.

It was tested on exported data from Elite HRV.

[RHRV](https://rhrv.r-forge.r-project.org/) is utilized to calculate time-domain and frequency-domain statistics on the filtered RR data.

The generated heatmap calendar is based on Ryan Plant's implementation: https://ryanplant.netlify.app/post/calendar-heatmaps-in-ggplot/
